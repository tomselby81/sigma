One of the three great astral guilds, the bounty hunters guild represents all bounty hunters, thieves, and assassins under it's employ. This guild is much less friendly to it's own members than the others. They offer no money, protection, or power unless you earn it. However, they take pride in offering job security to anyone who does the underworld's dirty work, always having new contracts to provide hunters with. They take a small cut of the reward in return for providing the job.
