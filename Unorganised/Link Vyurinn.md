White Dragonborn - Warlock

- Get rid of infection/curse

Backstory:

- Mother (Dragonborn) was infected but the infection wasn't visible physically. At some point during her life, she was kidnapped and taken onboard pirate ship, who forced her to have a child with the captain of the ship. Nine months later [[Link Vyurinn]] was born.

- The Captain of the ship was a cult priest, so he tried to infuse me with demonic magic and that backfired and made the infection from my mother spread further in me so it was clearer to see on my baby body so the captain thinking his infusion worked he laughs then watches in horror of a little dragonborn/Goliath baby hybrid morph into a juvenile white dragon and i take down the entire ship 

- Then my mother help me turn back into a baby and then she and i hide out in village with fellow lycanthropes about 12 others
