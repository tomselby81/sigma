A vaguely sock looking object, with eyes and a toothy grin drawn on it. Any PC who holds Konrad feels a compulsion to wear it on their hand. If a PC attempts to resist they must pass a DC 20 Wisdom check to successfully resist. 

Konrad believes that he is, in fact, not a sock, but a Gnome who is specifically green in colour. If any character attempts to convince him otherwise, he will become aggressive and refuse to talk to them like an immature teenager. 
He is genuinely omniscient, and has knowledge of everything in the universe. However, he consistently lies when questioned directly, but will accidentally drop hints during conversation.
