The Nightwalker is a lawful evil character, who is one of the primary recurring characters in The Storm Gate. It is not a direct antagonist, but will not aid the PCs without reason. This NPC will first appear sometime close to the ending of the [[DM Info(dont read pls)/Locations/The Dead Gate/Lake of Storms/Lake of Storms]] arc.

The Nightwalker is a [[Nightwalker]] who was summoned from the Negative Plane by a powerful sorcerer instead of being swapped with a living creature. Due to this, it has no driving purpose to kill its trapped creature like other nightwalkers would. It has been living in the material plane for long enough to have come to terms with its thirst for death, and now seeks to find its way back to the Negative Plane.

The Nightwalker resembles a normal [[Nightwalker]], although it is much shorter, at only about 9 feet tall and its horns have been severed close to the base. It wears a robe and has a weapon unknown to the PCs slung over its back. It uses a normal [[Nightwalker]] statblock but with an extra 10 points in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and with and extra 100 hit points.
The theme song for this NPC is: St James Infirmary by Hugh Laurie


Running this NPC:
The Nightwalker is bitter and angry at it's situation, although it is not entirely sure why. It is resourceful, unusually intelligent and only loyal to itself. It does not have a name for itself but all those who have survived meeting it call it The Nightwalker. It is a bounty hunter and assassin by trade.

When the PCs encounter this NPC, it will brush them off as useless, weak mortals and will ignore any attempts to communicate unless the PCs display an extraordinary feat of magic or strength. It will be encountered after the PCs first difficult battle, but will not engage with the PCs no matter what. It will reach out a hand and gather the lingering death from the creatures the players have killed. It will then pull the hood of its robe up and wander off into the distance. The players will find it has travelled in the direction of [[The Eternal Den]] if they try to follow or track it.
