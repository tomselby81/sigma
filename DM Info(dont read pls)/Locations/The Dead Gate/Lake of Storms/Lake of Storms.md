The Lake of Storms is an extremely young world, having existed for barely over three hundred years, barely an embryo in the timescale of the astral sea. It is a naturally formed magical world with typical low magic species appearing on it. It is a flat world and only takes up a few tens of kilometres of space. It is populated by a small number of towns and dungeons.

Due to the world's newness, a local pact has been enforced to allow it to develop until its magic stabilizes and the peoples have developed enough. The magic levels of the world recently reached a high enough threshold for this pact to be broken. This was also the event that freed the PCs from their time loop. When the pact was broken, a force of constructs sent by [[Asrasil]] have begun occupying towns, although they are trying to invade peacefully.
