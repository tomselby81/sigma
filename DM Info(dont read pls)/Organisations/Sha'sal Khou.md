## Organization
Although the [[Sha'sal Khou]] did not have a centralized leadership, its highest-ranking member was the [[githyanki]] warlord [[Zetch'r'r]]. Despite being sympathetic to the organization's cause,[[Zetch'r'r|Zetch'r'r's]] real intention was to forge a nation of unified [[Gith|gith]] under his leadership that could continue [[Gith|Gith's]] legacy of conquest with renewed resolve, something that he believed the [[githyanki]] of Tu'narath had lost.
This belligerent stance worried other members of the [[Sha'sal Khou]], but [[Zetch'r'r]] remained a strong advocate of their cause and a powerful force to attract new members.
## Activities
The [[Sha'sal Khou]] had among its goals the cessation of the hostilities between the [[githyanki]] and the [[githzerai]]. By amassing new members, they hoped to establish an army that could secure a fortified enclave where they could call each other simply "[[Gith|gith]]". In the long term, the organization aimed for the creation of a nation inhabited by unified [[Gith|gith]].
## Tactics
Members of the [[Sha'sal Khou]] operated undercover within both [[Gith|gith]] societies, attempting to defuse the tension between them and discouraging attacks against one another. At the same time, they were always looking to recruit [[Gith|gith]] who might share their point of view.
## Base of Operations
While the organization had secret strongholds in many locations of the Prime Material plane, one of their main bases was [[Zetch'r'r|Zetch'r'r's]] own stronghold located in the city of Tu'narath in the Astral Plane. It served as a shelter for its members and headquarters from which to plan their operations.
The organization also kept a secret base somewhere on the Sword Coast.
In the late 15th century DR, Urlon, the ruler of Stardock, attempted to make the asteroid into a stronghold for the Sha'sal Khou.

## Members
- [[Yrlakka]], a [[githzerai]] zerth who dwelt in Undermountain in the late 15th century DR.
- [[Belthomias]], a lieutenant to [[Zetch'r'r]] who brought together a rrakkma (a githzerai term for a hunting party against anyone who sought to oppress them) to stop a group of mind flayers from activating a powerful weapon, the Gith Capacitor, that was designed to remove the gith's psionic abilities so the mind flayers could reenslave them.
- [[Urlon]], the ruler of Stardock in the late 15th century DR.
