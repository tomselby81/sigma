Another of the great astral guilds, the Adventure Society is a more noble version of the [[Bounty Hunter's Guild]]. The Adventure Society creates contracts to protect civilians from danger, and assigns the contracts to adventurers. When an adventurer fullfills a contract, they receive a reward equal to their contribution in the contract. 
The Adventure Society is the largest force of order and good within the astral sea, having a large amount of support from common folk.
