The story opens in the town of [[DM Info(dont read pls)/Locations/The Dead Gate/Lake of Storms/Towns/Goldcot]] to each character individually waking up from their time loop. The DM is to describe the last thing they remember, a fight between the PCs and a high levelled necromancer. The DM is to go through each character individually, ask the player to describe their PC and their reaction to waking up. The players will then be presented with the map of the [[DM Info(dont read pls)/Locations/The Dead Gate/Lake of Storms/Lake of Storms]] and the party will be offered free reign to do as they please. They essentially have three options. Gather information and recuperate in [[DM Info(dont read pls)/Locations/The Dead Gate/Lake of Storms/Towns/Goldcot]], take the easy journey around to [[DM Info(dont read pls)/Locations/The Dead Gate/Lake of Storms/Towns/Mortherpoint]], or take the longer, more difficult journey to [[DM Info(dont read pls)/Locations/The Dead Gate/Lake of Storms/Towns/Emberfire]]. The DM is not to directly present these options unless the players ask or seem stuck. 

At this point, the players will either travel to [[DM Info(dont read pls)/Locations/The Dead Gate/Lake of Storms/Towns/Mortherpoint]] and learn of the construct invasion in [[DM Info(dont read pls)/Locations/The Dead Gate/Lake of Storms/Towns/Shadowcaste]], or they will meet [[The Nightwalker]] after a battle, during their journey to [[DM Info(dont read pls)/Locations/The Dead Gate/Lake of Storms/Towns/Emberfire]]. This sets up the branching choices for [[Chapter 2]].
