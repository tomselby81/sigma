The Players arrive in The Crown, in awe of its design and scale. 
They settled down, find lodgings and get Hoobah registered for citizenship. They are walking through a town square when music is heard playing around the corner. 
As a man rounds the corner, everyone in the square drops to their knees. The man is a short, humanoid monkey. He turns to the players and asks them.

The players are in SOMEHWERE when they are approached by a large leonin man. Recognising him as the man who approached when they entered The Crown. He offers them a job, a temporary Adventure Society contract, that many other low level people around The Crown and The Dead Gate are participating in. 
If they enquire more on the job, he will reveal that it is an expedition into an astral space. The players will not know what this is. He will explain that an astral space is a kind of half-reality that is suspended in the astral, attached to a larger physical object in the astral. They can only be entered via magical gateways, and due to the instability of this one, only people level 5 or below can enter. This is a small, mostly uninhabited astral space connected to The Crown. The reason the Adventure Society is looking for people to enter it is because something is drawing it away from the main physical reality that its attached to. The contract is to discover what is doing this, and stop it.
